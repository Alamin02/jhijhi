> A simple react app backed by Express JS to maintain cricket score

## Installation
Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed. Then run
```npm
npm install
```

After installation completes, run 
```npm
npm run dev
```

Wait a while. **Bingo!** The app's running in your browser.

If you don't have an account (you surely won't have in the first run), 
make one from the [Register](http://localhost:3000/register) page. 
Login and explore.

## Seeding
If you don't want to go through the hassle of inserting bunch of new data
and just want to explore the app, run
```npm
npm run seed <username>
```
Place your desired `username` in place of `<username>`.
Your password is same as the `username`.
