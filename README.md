> A simple react app backed by Express JS to maintain cricket score

## Installation
Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed. Then run
```bash
npm install
```

After installation completes, run 
```bash
npm run dev
```

Wait a while. **Bingo!** The app's running in your browser.

If you don't have an account (you surely won't have in the first run), 
make one from the [Register](http://localhost:3000/register) page. 

##### Finally, login and explore.
